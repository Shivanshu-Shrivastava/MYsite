                            Hi! I am Shivanshu Shrivastava, I've completed my Higher Education from Time School and currently pursuing B.Tech in Automobile Engineering from Madhav Institute of Technology & Science.<br />
                            I've done three internships from reputated companines.
                            In my first internship I was a front end developer and it was a great experience, learned how to manage time and how to write code with comments<b>(*most important)</b>.Here my job was to design CV builder and job portal websites. <br />
                            From my first internship experience, I survived the trauma of time management in my next internships(üòÅ just kidding).<br />
                            In my second internship I was a full stack developer and designed an email sender app using the nodemailer package. It was only a one month internship so nothing much happened here.<br />
                            Third internship was quite dangerous with fun here i designed a real-time dashboard and handled the integration of REST API and Database (MongoDB). And also Used Mqtt.Js for the implementation of the IoT part.
